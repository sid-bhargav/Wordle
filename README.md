# Wordle

Wordle clone made by me for an infinite number of games (really just 5757).

The game is played in the terminal, and follows all the rules Wordle does. Some of the words are unfortunately a little bit obscure, but I plan to change the list I'm using soon. 

The words are currently from a [list provided by Stanford](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/sgb-words.txt)

## Future plans

Currently the game can only be played in the terminal. I'm hoping to create a GUI soon
